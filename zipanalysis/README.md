# Zip Analysis Tools

These scripts were part of an effort to determine if cognitive complexity could be 
captured by measuring the size of compressed data using the gzip compression algorithm.
They were not used as part of the main processing and analysis of player games.
No relationship was found using the methods herein between player level and complexity 
of play. In starcraft II speed of operation often trumps cognitive complexity apparently.
